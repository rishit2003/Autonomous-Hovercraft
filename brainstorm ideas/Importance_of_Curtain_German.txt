This design will use one fan for lift and another for thrust. To give the hovercraft enough lift, 
we must include a skirt and a momentum curtain. The base of the HC will be made of an airtight skirt to make sure that all of the air being pushed by the fan is 
contributed to the air cushion on the bottom of the HC to reduce drag. Inside of the circular skirt, we will attach a lightweight material that blocks most of the 
fans airflow except for a small crevice. Reducing the area under the fan is crucial because of Bernoulli's principle. As the area lowers, the pressure increases and 
pushes the hovercraft higher. The drawback of this is increased weight for the craft. 
 For the control systems, we will use a fan and two rudders attached to a servo motor. Using a rudder is important because it provides yaw to the hovercraft which is 
needed to make turns around the obstacle course. Not using a rudder means that we must rotate the fan to create yaw which is not a good idea because this makes the 
hovercraft less stable by shifting its center of mass. We can also use more than one rudder to provide because they are lightweight and do not count as a component. 
The arduino and batteries will be put in near the front edge of the hovercraft and the fans at the back to make sure that the center of mass is not skewed because 
then it would be difficult to control.
 This design is relatively heavy compared to the other ideas because of the air tight skirt and momentum curtain. It trades in weight for stability and 
predictability of movement.
